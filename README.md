# Job Search Analyzer

## Project Description

This project is a Job Search Assistant that uses Gradio and Ollama as an interactive  AI-powered web applicationdesigned to help users explore career opportunities in the U.S government job market. 
The app combines public data from the USAJobs API with Ollama's local LLMs, creating a smart, privacy-preserving assistant that enhances the job search experience.

Users can receive personalized job title recommendations based on their skills, browse real-time job postings by category, analyze job descriptions using large language models (LLMs), and even get resume improvement suggestions tailored to the specific role they're targeting.

This project showcases the practical integration of open-source LLMs with government APIs and user-friendly UI frameworks.


## üéØ Purpose

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Assist users in identifying job opportunities that match their skills and interests

- Simplify access to federal job listings using the USAJobs API

- Leverage AI (Ollama + local LLMs) to generate meaningful job analysis and resume suggestions

- Provide a private, fast, and transparent alternative to cloud-based AI tools

- Demonstrate full-stack AI app development with Gradio, Python, REST APIs, and local LLMs
